        h5 Information

      p.
        Resources define your stock of materials, each resource has a cost per
        unit, an amount of units and a raw capacity.

        They can be simple things like "bottles of milk", "cans of chocolate" or
        they could even be something a bit more abstract like a worker or a 
        provider, who charges an hourly rate.

      p.
        If the #[b amount] is not defined, the resource is infinite, otherwise
        it is the number of units of this resource that have been purchased, if
        they're not consumed, it's considered waste, and the cost is divided
        divided between the products that used the resource.

      p.
        #[b Units] is the basic unit type this resource uses, for example grams,
        liters, mililiters. It's better if you use short names, it's the name
        of the unit that's consumed when using the resource.

      p.
        #[b Capacity] is the amount of units each full container has.  If capacity is not defined, it is set to 1.


      p.
        The #[b Cost Per Container] will be divided between the products using
        the resource. If there are wasted resources, the cost of the unused resources
        will be prorated between them.

      p.  
        #[b For example], a bottle of 1 liter of milk will have a capacity of 1000 (ml),
        if the amount is 1, it means we bought one 1000ml bottle of milk, the 
        products will be able to consume milliliters from this resource.
